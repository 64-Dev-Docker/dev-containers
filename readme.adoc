Bases for VSCode DevContainers
==============================

There is a far better repository by Microsoft https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers[here].

Here are my initial notes on this:

----
This is a quick walk through of setting up a development environment in VS Code using docker images. I don't claim great knowledge on this, I've got them running and they seem to be ok.

I'll share and discuss my Dockerfile and .devcontainer.json .

Discuss next steps (docker compose with multiple container environments).

Please invite other team members are you see fit, while I will be using GO and Sectigo as example, this would work with any other platform. 

To the best of my knowledge this technology does not apply to Visual Studio.
